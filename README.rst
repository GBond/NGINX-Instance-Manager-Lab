Introduction
============
Restructured Text markup code repository for the NGINX Instance Mamanger Lab Guide. This repository is tied to ReadTheDocs for webhook triggered publishing.

The purpose of this Lab is to introduce NGINX Instance Manager. NGINX Instance Manager is designed to make NGINX even easier to configure, use and maintain. We designed it from the ground up to be in line with the experience you expect from NGINX (small, lightweight, fast). NGINX Instance Manager is our latest product offerring and the lab is designed to showcase how to get started with it and what it can do.

NGINX Instance Manager is focused on using existing NGINX instances and the concepts in this lab can be applied to production environments.
